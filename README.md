# technical-documentation-page
This is a project built for the freeCodeCamp Responsive Web Design Certification. The goal was to create a technical documentation page using only HTML and CSS.

I chose Python as the topic, covering essential concepts such as variables, data types, conditionals, loops, functions, and more. The design includes a responsive layout and a fixed side navigation bar to help users easily browse through different sections.
